# The-Wizards-Crypt

The Wizards Crypt is a lock picking game where you have to guess the sequence of the buttons to unlock the crypt and move to the next level. As you select the buttons they turn green if they are correct in the sequence or red if they are wrong, as you see green in the sequence you should remember them to help you on your next attempt, you can press the reset button to clear your guess and try again. It's not just a guessing game as you can learn the correct sequence through trial and error. The sequence of the buttons changes with each level and your total guesses tally up showing you how many attempts it has taken you so that next time you play maybe you can get further with less guesses. 

The sequence game is great for brain training as you have to remember the sequences and is also a fun game just to pass sometime. The sequence is randomly generated  so everytime you play is completely different.
